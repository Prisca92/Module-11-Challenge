# Module-11-Challenge
In this two part challenge I used automated browsing (with Splinter)  to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup). First, I extracted the title and preview text of news articles I scrapped, then stored the python data structures.
I was then able to scrape and analyze the Mars Weather Data. The HTML table was also extracted into a Pandas DataFrame where I was able to examined the data types. When conducting my analysis I was able to answer the following questions:

* How many months exist on Mars?  12

* How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?  A total of 1867 Martian days.

* What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question: Month 3 was the coldest month, and month 8 was the warmest month on mars. 

* Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? Month 6 has the lowest atmospheric pressure and month 9 has the highest atmospheric pressure. 

* About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? A martian year is at least 625 terrestrial or Earth days ((750-500)/ 2 + 500).
